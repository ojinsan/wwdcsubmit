# wwdcsubmit # make it 24 game
Hi there!
My name is Fauzan Naufal Ramadhan from IndonesiaðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©!
Basically, I'm a farmer and used to live peacefully in a village for many years.
I saw many elementary-students here not to good in calculating basic math.
So I decided to create a game to help them.


I designed a puzzle game. I was inspired by the card-game called 24 that popular in Indonesia youngster.
This game will help the user to upgrade basic math skills and basic analysis.
The game is really simple.

Imagine that we are given 4 random numbers. The goal is to make these 4 numbers to generate a number of 24.
We can take 2 number and use adder, subtractor, multiplier, or divider
to combine the two numbers so we'll have a new number as the result of the previously-made equation.
We can use the resulting number to the next equation. But the used two numbers can't be used anymore.
We can use the operator as many as we want.

For example,
we get 3,2,4,1.
We can catch the number of 3, 2, and a multiplier, so as a result, we will get a new number of 6.
Next, let's catch the number of 4, 1, and a divider, so we can get a new number of 4.
The last step is to catch the number of previously-generated 4 and 6, and catch multiplier.
Viola, we get 24! And you will get +5 points for that stage.

If you feel stuck, just make the nearest number from 24 by these 4 numbers.
You'll be got penalties, your score will be subtracted by the differences within your result and 24!

Try to get the highest score in three minutes, and beat your friends!
